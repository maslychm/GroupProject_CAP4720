# GroupProject_CAP4720
The goal of our project is to learn how to use shaders effectively, and how to dynamically apply them to objects in a Unity scene, based only on user input. We want to learn HLSL and be able to compute shades of objects based on the following data: player position and speed relative to the objects in scene, game "score", time passed in the game and speed of each object separately. We want to make use of Unity's built-in Physics to get the above listed.

We want to demonstrate effective use of shaders and provide visual feedback based on user input. The only form of information given back to the player will be through visual cues (no text-prompts outside of informing players what the controls are)
